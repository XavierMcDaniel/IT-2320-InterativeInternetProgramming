				<h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
				<p>My name is Xavier McDaniel. I am currently a resident of East Cleveland, Ohio. I am 16 years old and am a participant of the 
				College Credit Plus (CCP) program. </p>
				<h3>What am I Doing at Tri-C?</h3>
				<p>My major is in Information Technology. As of now, I have received a certificate in Mobile Application Development. I had the 
				privilege of being in the Tri-C spring commencement program this year. When I first started to take college courses at Tri-C, I was 
				12 years old. Though I have some experience with HTML and CSS, I look forward to learning more on JavaScript as well.</p>
				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I live with my 4 siblings, my parents, and our 3 turtles, Shadow, Shellie, and Spike. I love to play the drums in our family&#39;s 
				band. We are performing at a wedding this weekend in Columbus, Ohio for a friend of ours. Other interests I have are playing video 
				games on my PS3 and playing basketball. </p>
